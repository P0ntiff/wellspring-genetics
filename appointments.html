            <strong>NB: </strong> Patients who have an uncertain diagnosis or
            a significant family history of a genetic condition will need a
            referral to see Dr Michael Gattas for a medical assessment at
            <a href="https://brisbanegenetics.com.au" class="link">Brisbane Genetics</a>. For all other patients,
            please read below.

            Prenatal or pre-pregnancy appointment
          </h3>
          <p class="bodytxt">
            This appointment is for couples and single patients interested in
            gene testing to decrease their chance of having a child with a
            serious health problem.
            <br /><br />
            Approximately 1 in 300 couples will have a child with cystic
            fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy, fragile X syndrome or an
            autosomal recessive disorder that could have been detected in
            advance.
            <br /><br />
            80% of these couples have NO family history of the condition. If
            none of these problems have happened before in your family, this
            does NOT mean that it could not happen to you.
            <br /><br />
            Knowing you are a carrier allows you to have other options that
            include testing in a pregnancy (called pre-natal diagnosis), or
            using IVF and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) to avoid
            having a child with a serious medical problem.
            <br /><br />
            Pre-pregnancy carrier testing is only needed once, and the
            information will benefit this couple for every subsequent
            pregnancy with the same partner.

            Well adult appointment
          </h3>
          <p class="bodytxt">
            This appointment is for healthy adults interested in a gene test
            that may predict a future health problem.
            <br /><br />
            The cost of gene testing some important genes such as BRCA1 and
            BRCA2 is now a few hundred dollars. Even with no Medicare or
            private insurance rebate, gene testing has become very affordable.
            <br /><br />
            People who like to be pro-active with their health should see
            their General Practitioner for advice, but GPs and other doctors
            find it hard to keep up with the rapid progress in molecular
            genetic testing. This is the service provided by a Genetic
            Counsellor who can inform you and your doctor about these tests.

            When you meet the Genetic Counsellor, she will ask you about your
            family history, draw a family tree, and ask about any current
            medical problems. For a couple's appointment, the same history
            will be collected from your partner.
            <br /><br />
            In preparation for the appointment, write down the medical history
            for your parents, siblings, grandparents (on maternal and paternal
            sides), uncles, aunts and all your cousins as best you can.
            <br /><br />
            Next will be an explanation about the test options for
            pre-pregnancy or well adult testing. <br />
            • What genes will be tested? <br />
            • How are the tests are performed? <br />

            • What do the tests cost? <br />
            • How will I get these results? <br />
            • What do I do if I have an adverse result?
            <br /><br />
            A blood sample or saliva sample can be collected the same day.
            <br /><br />
            An email will be sent to you with a summary letter and your
            results. This letter and results will also be sent to your
            preferred doctor.

            Wellspring Genetics is independent of any pathology company. It
            therefore can offer tests from a wide range of Australian and
            overseas medical laboratories.
            <br /><br />
            These laboratories include (in alphabetical order): <br /><br />
            <a class="link" href="https://www.color.com/"> Color </a> <br />
            <a class="link" href="https://www.invitae.com/en/"> Invitae </a>
            <br />
            <a class="link" href="https://genomicdiagnostics.com.au/">
              QML via Genomic Diagnostics
            </a>
            <br />
            <a class="link" href="https://www.sonicgenetics.com.au/">
              Sullivan Nicolaides via Sonic Genetics
            </a>
            <br />
            <a class="link" href="https://www.vcgs.org.au/">
              VCGS Pathology
            </a>
            <br />
            <br />
            These laboratories are all certified by the relevant quality
            assurance authorities for medical testing. This means the results
            are highly reliable. Surprisingly this quality assurance safeguard
            is not mandatory for all DNA tests that are sold direct to the
            public in Australia.
            <br /><br />
            Many of these tests are not available in the public health system,
            and prenatal carrier screening is not offered at all in the public
            system.
            <br /><br />
            The cost of gene testing varies from about $350 to $995 depending
            on the test requested. The most common test costs about $400.
            <br /><br />
            This test cost is paid to the pathology laboratory, not to
            Wellspring Genetics.

            <strong>What is the cost of an appointment?</strong>
            <br /><br />

            A 30 minute appointment costs $220. The price
            for any couple for pre-pregnancy screening is $300.
            <br /><br />
            <br />
            <strong>What is the waiting time for an appointment?</strong>
            <br /><br />

            Usually within 2-3 weeks.
            <br /><br />
            <br />

            <strong>Does Medicare or private insurance pay for the
              appointment?</strong>
            <br /><br />

            There is no Medicare rebate for the appointment. Private health
            insurers in Australia usually do not pay for the appointment, but
            you should check with your insurer as health insurance policies
            are changing.
            <br /><br />
            Visitors from overseas may have medical insurance policies that
            will cover the cost of the appointment. They will need to check
            this with their insurance provider.

            <strong>Does Medicare or private insurance pay for pre-pregnancy or
              well adult gene testing?</strong>
            <br /><br />

            No. The cost of gene testing varies from about $350 to $995
            depending on the test requested. The most common tests cost about
            $400
            <br /><br />
            <br />
            <strong>Can I bring another family member?</strong>
            <br /><br />

            Yes for couples testing or a pre-pregnancy appointment. This will
            cost $300.
            <br /><br />

            Yes for a well adult appointment, but the second family member
            needs to book a consecutive time slot if they are planning to have
            testing for themselves. This consecutive slot will cost the same
            price of $220.
            <br /><br />

            Three or more family members cannot be seen at the same time.
            <br /><br />
            <br />
            <strong>Do I need a referral?</strong>
            <br /><br />

            No referral is needed for appointments at Wellspring Genetics,
            though patients who have an uncertain diagnosis, or a significant
            family history of a genetic condition, will need a referral to see
            Dr Michael Gattas for a medical assessment at Brisbane Genetics.
